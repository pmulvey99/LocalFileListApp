# LocalFileListApp
### A small desktop app written in C# .NET 6 &amp; WPF which probes available disks and iterates the selected disk contents.

The purpose of the app is to demonstrate some language features and concepts such as:

- MVVM design with data binding, value converters
- Async/Task-based work to keep the user interface responsive
- Unit testing of the viewmodel, including mock interface dependency injection

Time taken: about one and a half days... much of which was debugging visual elements in WPF, such as binding of icons for the TreeViewItems and DataGridItems...
